Risk Analysis On Loan Defaulters By Using Machine Learning

This project was aimed at building a machine learning model that predicted the Defaulters on loans based on various attributes given in the data by Lending Club. These attribuites consisted of close to 28 features ranging from age to occupation to gender and credit card behavior to judge if someone will default on a given loan. This model will help in allowing potential investors make better decisions on any future loans or candidates they may deem as a good profitable investment and do not rely on the potential adding too much risk knowing that a model that has been trained on this data has given them data driven insights on the decision making.
